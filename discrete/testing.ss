    ;; a name,
    ;; a parenthesis-enclosed sequence
    ;; of zero or more binding specifications,
    ;; and zero or more test-expressions (described below).
    ;; It binds the identifiers in the binding specifications
    ;; to the values of the corresponding expressions,
    ;; evaluates the test-expressions
    ;; in the environment established by those bindings,
    ;; and tallies and reports the number of tests that succeeded
    ;; (returning #t) and the number that failed (returning #f).
    ;; The value of the suite-expression
    ;; is #t if no test failed,
    ;; #f if one or more tests failed.

    ;; The test syntax has four or five subexpressions.
    ;;
    ;; * The first is an identifier
    ;;   indicating the nature of the test to be conducted. 
    ;;
    ;; * The second is an expression embodying the test:
    ;;   the values of the expression are the results of the test.
    ;;
    ;; * The third is a numeral
    ;;   indicating how many results the test should produce.
    ;;
    ;; * The fourth is a list of expressions,
    ;;   equal in number to the value of the preceding numeral.
    ;;   The value of each expression in the list is a predicate;
    ;;   the corresponding result is required
    ;;   to satisfy this predicate.
    ;;
    ;; * The fifth, which is optional, is an expression
    ;;   of which the value is a predicate.
    ;;   This predicate is applied to all of the results
    ;;   (as arguments in a single call)
    ;;   and they are required to satisfy it.
    ;;
    ;; The value of the test-expression is #t
    ;; if all of the requirements imposed
    ;; by the third, fourth, and fifth subexpression
    ;; are satisfied,
    ;; #f if any of those subexpressions fails.
